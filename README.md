# Introduction

This project was completed as part of BUS4022 course assignment. A full description of the requirements for the project and description of the raw data provided is given in the pdf file "Group_Capstone_Assignment_3". The following deliverables were completed as,
- [x] **Data cleaning** - Starting with the LOAN_PORTFOLIO_Original.csv file,
    * I cleaned the data, looking for missing values, 
    * Merged closely related categorical lables, e.g. for the variable LiteracyLevel, "N" and "O" both denotes "No Formal Education" were merged together.
    * Data formatting (e.g. monetary values were formatted to be 2 decimal places).
    * New meaningful variables (derived) which would help in the analysis were added.
- [x] **Data Audit** - provide commentary and notes on the; accuracy, consistency and completeness of each variable. Results are given in the 19_Assignment_3_Part_1_Data_Audit_and_Preliminary_Assessment_Appendix file. A descriptive analysis of the variables, along with the description of the variables is given in the 19_Assignment_3_Part_1_Data_Audit_and_Preliminary_Assessment_Report_ document.
- [x] **Exploratory Data Analysis** - The result of this is summarized in the file, 19_Assignment_3_Part_3_EDA.
- [x] **Tableau Dashboard and Data Story** - A Tableau file, 19_Assignment_3_Part_4_Dashboard, was created with interesting relationship between variables and heatmap. Screenshots from my Tableau dashboard are given below.
